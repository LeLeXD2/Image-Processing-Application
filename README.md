### Image Processing Application ###
### Product Description ###
Created an interactive webcam-based application using p5.js and ml5.js. The project performs real-time image processing such as thresholding, color space conversion, and privacy filters like face blur and pixelation. It also includes fun face filters and hand detection for gesture-based interaction and visual effects.

### Features ###
- Access webcam feed and display it on the canvas in real time.
- Convert the live image between color spaces (RGB â†” grayscale, HSV/HSB) and show results.
- Apply image thresholding (binary threshold, adaptive threshold) to the live feed.
- Implement basic filters applied to the entire frame: invert, brightness/contrast, blur, sharpen, edge-detect.
- Add privacy-enhancing face filters 
- Implement face filters
- Use face detection & landmarks to accurately localize faces and align overlays/filters.
- Add hand detection to track hands and fingertips for interaction:
